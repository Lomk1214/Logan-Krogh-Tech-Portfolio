##### <u>Bio</u>

I am a Computer Engineering student at BYUâ€“Idaho who enjoys creating software applications and working with hardware. During my time at school, I have developed crucial skills in various areas, ranging from software (C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.) to hardware design and construction (Altium Designer, Logisim, soldering, etc.). I am often tasked with projects that require me to learn new programming languages and IDEs that I have never used before (such as JavaScript, Flutter, and HTML) in a short amount of time. Through these experiences, I have gained the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies.
