The design fills the pot to a specific height/amount of water and then shuts off. If the height isn't reached the user is warned and told there was an error. The LED's and LCD screen help show which mode the program is in, whether idle, filling, done, or error.</p>\n\n            <div  class = \"projects-skillbox\">Embedded Systems Programming</div>\n            <div  class = \"projects-skillbox\">C Programming</div>\n            <div  class = \"projects-skillbox\">Digital I/O Conttrol</div> \n            </div> \n        <div class = \"projects-itembox\">\n            <h6><u><b><a href= \"https://github.com/Lomk1214/playlist-maker.git\" target = \"_blank\">Music Playlist Creator</a></b></u></h6>\n            <p>A web app that allows the user to use URLs from YouTube and Spotify to create their own playlist using songs from both sites.
