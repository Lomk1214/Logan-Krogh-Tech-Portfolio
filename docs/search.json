    "text": "November 19, 2025\n        This last October I had the opportunity to participate in the BYUI's hackathon, held on campus in the STC. This was my first time doing a hackathon and joining it was a last second decision. I went in with very little idea of what I was going to do or who my teammates were going to be. After making a team with another computer engineer and then later being joined by a third, all of whom were also first-time attendees, we got to brainstorming. We eventually decided on creating a smart cane for the visually impaired.\n        The idea was that the cane would vibrate when swung too close to an object, so we used 3 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors (for the left, right, and front of the cane), and a buzzer and designed a circuit that we connected to an esp32. We then designed an app that connected to the esp32 via Bluetooth. This app allowed the user to adjust the range of the sensor, see live updates of where the closest object is, and had a find my function that caused the cane to beep whereever it was.\n        The whole competition was such a unique and fun experience. From finally getting our circuit and code working at 5 am to talking and chatting with other groups about each others projects, the whole event was memorable from the start to the end. While it was definitely an endurance test, I plan on doing it again next fall.       \n        \n    \n        June 12, 2025\n        Since working at the Mac Lab, I have significantly refined my skills with the 3D printer, specifically with reading and understanding G-code. G-code is the file that you get after you slice a 3D model. It is split into many individual layers that are stacked on top of each other to create the model that it was given. This code tells the printer where and how it should print out filament to get the desired design. What I've learned most about it, however, is that it can easily hide print-destroying errors. The two types I have run into the most are 1. Not starting on the build plate, and 2. Faulty interior of the model.\n        \n            \n                Problem 1\n            \n            When you slice a model and convert it to G-code, it should be generated in such a way that the printer starts from the bottom, prints the beginnings of the model and any required supports, and then gradually builds up to the top. However, due to the construction of the given model, the print may not actually be touching the build plate. This prevents it from forming a solid base, causing the printer to trail filament behind it in a bunched-up ball.\n            \n            The easiest way to fix this is to check the bottom of the model in the preview tab and see if the part of the model that should touch the build plate is colored to match the \"solid infill\" indicator. If not, you can return to the 3D editor view and use the \"Place on Face\" tool. This tells the slicer which part of the model should be anchored to the build plate. When you preview the model again, you should see the color of the section touching the plate change, confirming that it has been set correctly.\n        \n        \n            \n                Problem 2\n            \n            The second problem is most often caused by issues in the interior of the model. When we see a 3D model, we can only see the outside, not the inside. The slicer, however, can. Like an X-ray, the slicer can see the inside mesh and will model the G-code accordingly. For example, a 3D model may look solid, but it can have an empty sphere on the inside. This doesn't always lead to failure, but sometimes the model will have gaps in between layers only on the interior, causing the printer to again print in mid-air. You can generally find these problems if you use the Layer Slicer and slowly look through the layers till you find the empty layer.\n            \n            The solution to this problem is more complicated than the first, requiring that you take the model and print it into parts, edit it in another program, or find another model altogether.\n        \n        \n\n\n\nHome | Experience | Projects"
