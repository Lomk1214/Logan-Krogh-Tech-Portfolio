            <p>Designed a circuit comprised of 3 ultrasonic sensors and an ESP32 that would activate a buzzer when swung too close to an object and attached it to a 3d cane that the team modeled and printed. Created an app that connects to cane via Bluetooth, allowing the user to adjust the sensor sensitivity as well as having a functioning “find my” function</p>

            <p>Created and Emulated a fully functioning 4-bit Micro-Processor through the logisim-Evolution program. Includes a fully functioning register, with read, write, and enabled options are included alongside an ALU, allowing for binary or hexadecimal math. The emulator also connects to windows ASCII, allowing for programable text output.</p>

            <p> A team project where we saw a need for students who were leaving Rexburg who needed a ride, or were willing to offer one. The app functions as a job board, where posts are put on display and can be sorted by date leaving or posted, price for ride, and location. Account information created and saved through users google account.</p>

            <p>A programmed prototype with using an LCD screen, motor pump, a green, blue, yellow and red LED, and water level sensor that have their functions programmed in C and loaded onto a STM32L476RG Nucleo board. The design fills the pot to a specific height/amount of water and then shuts off. If the height isn't reached the user is warned and told there was an error. The LED's and LCD screen help show which mode the program is in, whether idle, filling, done, or error.</p>
